# DataVisualizationHomework3

Point of the study: 
How can we detect fakenews ?

0) Cleaning dataset so we don't get the urls
1) Proportion of fake vs real
2) Are fake news more shared than real ones ?
3) Can we judge if news are fake depending on the website ?
4) Are some websites more shared than others ? (Would also mean they might be more followed on twitter)
5) Which words are the more present in the titles ? (Excluding any stopword)
6) Are some subjects more shared than others ?
7) Are some subjects more propice to be fake ?
8) Are titles containing insults more likely to get shared ?
9) Are titles containing ... more likely to get shared ? (I'm thinking about the too enthusiastic titles but maybe other words will come up in the study)
